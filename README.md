# Mustache for Dart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/valotas/mustache4dart.svg?branch=dart2)](https://travis-ci.org/valotas/mustache4dart)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/valotas/mustache4dart/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/valotas/mustache4dart?branch=master)

A simple implementation of [Mustache][mustache] for the
[Dart language][dartlang], which passes happily all the
[mustache v1.1.2+Î» specs][specs]. If you want to have a look at how it works,
just check the [tests][tests]. For more info, just read further.

## Using it

In order to use the library, just add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as a dependency.

For dart v1, you should be using the v2 of this package:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mustache4dart: ">= 2.0.0 < 3.0.0"
```

For dart v2, you should be using the v3 of this package:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mustache4dart: ">= 3.0.0 < 4.0.0"
```

and then import the package

```dart
import 'package:mustache4dart/mustache4dart.dart';
```

and you are good to go. You can use the render toplevel function to render your
template.

For example:

```dart
var salutation = render('Hello {{name}}!', {'name': 'Bob'});
print(salutation); //shoud print Hello Bob!
```

### Context objects

mustache4dart will look at your given object for operators, fields or methods.
For example, if you give the template `{{firstname}}` for rendering,
mustache4dart will try the followings

1. use the `[]` operator with `firstname` as the parameter
2. search for a field named `firstname`
3. search for a getter named `firstname`
4. search for a method named `firstname` (see Lambdas support)

in each case the first valid value will be used.

### Partials

mustache4dart support partials but it needs somehow to know how to find a
partial. You can do that by providing a function that returns a template
given a name:

```dart
String partialProvider(String partialName) => "this is the partial with name: ${partialName}";
expect(render('[{{>p}}]', null, partial: partialProvider), '[this is the partial with name: p]'));
```

### Compiling to functions

If you have a template that you are going to reuse with different contexts,
you can compile it to a function using the toplevel function compile:

```dart
var salut = compile('Hello {{name}}!');
print(salut({'name': 'Alice'})); //should print Hello Alice!
```

### Lambdas support

The library passes all the optional [lambda specs][lambda_specs] based on
which lambdas must be treated as arity 0 or 1 functions. As dart provides
optional named parameters, you can pass to a given lambda function the
`nestedContext`. In that case the current nested context will be given as
parameter to the lambda function.

## Flutter / Browser support

In order to achive support on targets where `dart:mirrors` is not allowed,
[`reflectable`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/reflectable) is being used.
In such a case the user should mark the objects used by mustache4dart with
`@MustacheContext()` and make sure that the reflectable builder is being run
accordingly.

### `reflectable` setup

The easiest way to get reflectable to work is by making use of
[`build_runner`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/build_runner) with a
`build.yaml` that should look like:

```yaml
targets:
  # your package name, in my case is mustache4dart
  mustache4dart:
    builders:
      reflectable:
        # a list of dart files containing the annotated code,
        # in my case that is only some test files
        generate_for:
          - test/**_test.dart
        options:
          formatted: true
```

## Developing

The project passes all the [Mustache specs][specs]. You have to make sure
though that you've downloaded them. Just make sure that you have done the
steps described below.

```sh
git clone git://github.com/valotas/mustache4dart.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
pub get
```

If you are with Linux, you can use what [travis][travis] does:

```sh
./build.sh
```

Alternatively, if you have [Dart Test Runner][testrunner] installed you can
just do:

```
pub global run test_runner
```

### Observatory

To start the observatory after running test:

```sh
dart --pause-isolates-on-exit --enable-vm-service=NNNN ./test/mustache_all.dart
```

Then [`coverage`][coverage] can be used in order to collect and format data:

```sh
pub global run coverage:collect_coverage --uri=http://... -o /tmp/mustache4dart.coverage.json --resume-isolates
pub global run coverage:format_coverage --packages=app_package/.packages -i /tmp/mustache4dart.coverage.json
```

and issue a pull request with you fix.
